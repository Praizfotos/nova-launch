//! Governance Delegation System — Type Definitions
//!
//! Defines all on-chain data structures, storage keys, and error codes
//! used by the governance delegation contract.
//!
//! This module contains two sets of types:
//!  1. Delegation system types (vote-power transfer, snapshots)
//!  2. Proposal/voting types (on-chain governance proposals)
